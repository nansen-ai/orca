## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.7] - 2026-03-21

### Changed

- **Explicit spawn lineage is now mandatory:** `orca spawn` requires `--spawned-by` on every call. Use `--spawned-by root` (or `root:<scope>`) for top-level orchestrator spawns, and `--spawned-by <worker-name>` for sub-workers. Orca no longer relies on implicit parent inference for correctness.
- **Clarified `--spawned-by` help text, errors, and SPEC:** help text, error messages, SKILL.md, and SPEC.md now emphasize that sub-workers must pass their plain worker name (e.g. `fin`, `mud`) — not the emoji label, not `root`. `root` is reserved for top-level orchestrators (L0) only. SPEC.md documents the full hierarchy: L0 = orchestrator (not an orca worker), L1 = direct workers (`--spawned-by root`), L2+ = sub-workers (`--spawned-by <worker-name>`).

### Fixed

- **Orphaned sub-workers causing wrong emoji / wake target / premature completion:** delegated workers that forgot lineage now fail closed instead of silently becoming root `🐳 L1` workers. This prevents missing `spawned_by` from breaking `has_running_children`, routing completion notifications to the wrong orchestrator, or waking OpenClaw while an intermediate worker is only waiting on its own children.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **Nested lineage fallback when `ORCA_WORKER_NAME` is missing:** `orca spawn` now infers parentage from the current tmux pane (`pane_id`) when env-based parent inference is unavailable. This prevents delegated workers spawned from an L1 pane from silently becoming root `🐳 L1` workers with empty `spawned_by`; they now inherit the real parent and resolve to `🐬 L2`/deeper as expected.

### Added

- **Lineage regression tests:** added CLI unit tests covering parent inference priority (env first, pane fallback) and depth promotion (`L1` parent -> `L2` child) when parent is inferred from pane context.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- **Auto-stash before worktree removal:** `orca kill`, `killall`, and `gc` now run `git stash push -u` on dirty worktrees before removing them, preserving uncommitted work. Stashes attach to the main repo and can be recovered with `git stash list` / `git stash pop` from the project root.
- **`--no-stash` flag:** Pass `--no-stash` to `kill`, `killall`, or `gc` to skip auto-stashing (automation escape hatch).
- **`STASH_PRESERVE` audit log entries:** When a stash is created, a `STASH_PRESERVE` line is appended to `audit.log` for correlation with `KILL`/`GC` events.
- **`config::audit()` shared function:** The audit log writer is now accessible from any module (previously private to `cli.rs`).

### Changed

- **SPEC.md:** Added Git prerequisite section, `ensure_git_repo` auto-init documentation, cleanup/stash recovery instructions, and a "Where to Look When Things Go Wrong" audit reference table.
- **README.md:** Git listed as an explicit prerequisite.
- **SKILL.md:** New "Recovering work after `orca kill`/`gc`" section for orchestrators, with stash recovery instructions and debugging pointers.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- **Stricter `orca spawn` validation for agents:** `--orchestrator none` is rejected by default — pass `cc`, `cx`, `cu`, or `openclaw`, or set `ORCA_ALLOW_SPAWN_WITHOUT_ORCHESTRATOR=1` for headless/scripts (e.g. autoimprove).
- **Unknown orchestrator rejection:** unknown `--orchestrator` values (typos like `ccc`, `CC`, etc.) are rejected with an error listing valid options, preventing silent notification failures.
- **`openclaw` reply routing required:** `--orchestrator openclaw` now requires `--reply-channel` and `--reply-to` unless `ORCA_ALLOW_OPENCLAW_WITHOUT_REPLY=1`.
- **Parent lineage:** `--spawned-by` must name a tracked worker; if `ORCA_WORKER_NAME` names a tracked worker it must match the resolved parent (prevents "orphan" L1 children and wrong idle / hook behavior). Stale `ORCA_WORKER_NAME` with an explicit valid `--spawned-by` is still allowed.

### Fixed

- **Flaky `state` tests:** each test using `ORCA_HOME` now gets an isolated temp dir under a mutex so parallel `cargo test` no longer races on one shared state file.

### Changed

- Agent skill (`SKILL.md`): rewritten with per-agent-type sections (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenClaw) showing exact required flags and examples. Sub-worker section clarifies `ORCA_WORKER_NAME` auto-inference vs explicit `--spawned-by`.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **Spawn depth & labels (fixes "everyone is a whale" / wrong L1):** Conceptually **L0** is the outer orchestrator (e.g. OpenClaw) and is not an Orca worker row. The **first** `orca spawn` from L0 uses `--depth 0` → stored depth **1** (🐳 L1). Delegates spawned **from inside** an existing worker pane should be **one level deeper** (🐬 L2, …), but if `--spawned-by` / depth were omitted they were all stored as depth **1**. `orca spawn` now, when `ORCA_WORKER_NAME` matches a tracked worker, infers **`--spawned-by`** and copies **parent `depth`** from state before computing the child's stored depth, so parent links and L2/L3 labels match the real tree (daemon idle logic and `has_running_children` also see correct `spawned_by`).
- **Premature "done" from lifecycle hooks while sub-workers run:** Orchestrator panes often hit the IDE **stop** hook in between turns even while they are only waiting on **child** workers. That produced `orca report --event done --source hook`, set `done_reported`, and woke the **next** orchestrator (e.g. OpenClaw) as if the L1 worker had finished. Hook-sourced **`done`** is now rewritten to **`heartbeat`** while the worker still has children in **`running`** or **`blocked`**, so completion propagation waits until delegates finish. To record a real **`done`** while children exist (rare), use `orca report --source cli`.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-03-20

_(This release was tagged without a changelog entry; summarized here retroactively.)_

### Fixed

- Tmux: add a 10s timeout around subprocess execution so the daemon cannot hang indefinitely ([#8](https://github.com/araa47/orca/pull/8)).

### Changed

- Performance: simplify Codex idle-screen detection ([#6](https://github.com/araa47/orca/pull/6)); cache `normalize_window_name` regex with `LazyLock` ([#5](https://github.com/araa47/orca/pull/5)).

### Fixed

- Truncate task previews on Unicode character boundaries to avoid UTF-8 panics ([#4](https://github.com/araa47/orca/pull/4)).

### Added

- Documentation: OpenClaw as orchestrator and agent setup for reliable Orca discovery ([#1](https://github.com/araa47/orca/pull/1), [#2](https://github.com/araa47/orca/pull/2)).

## [0.0.1] - 2025-03-19

### Added

- Initial stable Rust release.
- CLI: spawn, list, logs, steer, kill, gc, pane, report, daemon, hooks.
- Isolated workers in git worktrees; tmux-based monitoring and notifications.
- Support for OpenClaw, Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor as orchestrator backends.
- Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor as worker backends.
- Pre-commit/prek hooks (fmt, clippy, yaml, codespell); CI split into job-prek and job-test.
